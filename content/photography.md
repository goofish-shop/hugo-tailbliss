## A Shadow of Herself

Floating like a world of independence, feathered and immortal, the wind has not changed, the mood has changed, the love of the bell, not about the wind and moon, in the spirit of abundance, independence of thought. The world and independence need not be understood, be appreciated.
Get enough happiness from themselves, coupled with landscape scenery given, contemporary women can also be cold and lonely, proud and elegant, away from the so-called secular shackles.

In the iron bars, barbed wire fences under the addition of more embodied confinement, tough, cold prison life, is no freedom, no hope, as a puppet, then, human beings try their best to explore the progress of society and for what?
